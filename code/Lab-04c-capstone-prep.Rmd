```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```{r initialization}

```{r dataImport}

data <- read.csv("../data/parkinsons_data.data")
glimpse(data) %>% head()
``` 


```{r dataCleaning}
data <- rename(data, subject = subject.)
sub_counts <- group_by(data, subject) %>% count(subject)
sub_counts
```
Note: graph of # of recordings, slope of the data (days vs updrs score) 
```{r}
ggplot(sub_counts, aes(x = subject, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of subject vs number of recordings",
       x = "Subject",
       y = "N") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The dataset has 42 subjects, with 28 males and 14 females. Each subject had a different number of recordings, with the number ranging from 101 to 168. Due to the discrepancy between the number of recordings available to each subject, we decided to <INSERT PLAN HERE>. 

We took the mean of all the metrics. 
```{r}
mean_vals <- data %>% group_by(subject) %>% summarise(across(1: PPE, .fns = mean))
mean_vals
```


## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
gender_count <- group_by(data, sex, subject) %>% count(sex)
gender_count
```
