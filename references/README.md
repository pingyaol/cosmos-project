Data Dictionary 

Jitters and Shimmers data were collected using the KP-MDVP test. 

1. subject# - unique test subject identifier 
2. age - age of the sbject 
3. test_time - days since recruitment to the project 
4. Jitter(%) - variation in fundamental frequency of speech as a percent 
5. Jitter(Abs) - absolute jitter in microseconds 
6. Jitter:RAP - Relative Amplitude Pertubation 
7. Jitter:PPQ5 -five point Period Pertubation Quotient 
8. Jitter:DDP - average absolute difference of differences between jitter cycles, divided by the average period 
9. Shimmer - variations of amplitude of sound waves 
10. Shimmer(dB) - shimmer in decibels 
11. Shimmer:APQ3 - three point Period Pertubation Quotient 
12. Shimmer:APQ5 - five point Period Pertubation Quotient 
13. Shimmer:APQ11 - eleven point Period Pertubation Quotient 
14. Shimmer:DDA - average absolute difference of differences between the amplitudes of consecutive periods 
15. NHR - noise-to-harmonics ratio 
16. HNR - harmonic-to-noise ratio, measures the ratio between periodic and non-periodic
components of a speech sound
17. RPDE - Recurrence Period Density Entropy
